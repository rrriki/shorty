# Shorty

A very simple URL shortner service, written using Go and Mongodb, to familiarize myself with the language.

It has 3 methods: shorten a long url, expand a previously shortened url and redirect from a shortened url.

> To redirect just paste the short url in your address bar

## Usage

Clone or download the repo.

  

```sh

$ cd shorty

$ go run main.go

```
